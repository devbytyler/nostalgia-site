<h3>Carne (Beef)</h3>
	<img alt="carne" src="img/carne.jpg" />
	<p>Beef is the staple meat of the Argentine asado. It is common to see cuts such as costilla (ribs), matambre (close to the ribs), falda (sides), puchero (rear), and corazon (heart.)  </p>
	
<h3>Pollo (Chicken)</h3>
	<img alt="pollo" src="img/pollo.jpg" />
	<p>Since beef is often expensive, it is often more economicaland just as delicious to grill up some chicken. This can be done whole chickens at a time or also just legs and thighs and other pieces. Served best with mustard and mayonnaise. </p>
	
<h3>Chorizo (Sausage)</h3>

	<p>Chewy and flavorful, these bits and pieces of the intestine are also welcome to the asado, as long as you don't think to much about what you are eating. </p>
