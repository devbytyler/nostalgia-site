<h2>The Sides</h2>

<h3>Ensalada (Salad)</h3>
	<img alt="ensalada" src="img/ensalada.jpg" />
	<p>A perfect and simple combination of lettuce, onions, tomatoes, salt, and lemon juice makes the best side for any asado. When you get tired of chewing the dense and fatty meat, take a bite of this refreshing and flavorful salad </p>
	
<h3>Pan (Bread)</h3>
	<img alt="pan" src="img/pan.jpg" />
	<p>Any meal without bread would not be Argentine. Bread is eaten in almost every other bite. It also great to soak up all those juices that stay behind on the plate. </p>
	
<h3>Mate</h3>

	<p>Great before, during, and after, mate is an herbal tea drunken by 99% of argentines. It is full of antioxidantes and drinking it is a great way to spend time, during an asado or not.</p>
	
<h3>Chimichurri</h3>

	<p>Comparable as the Argentine salsa, chimichurri is a sauce made from peppers, spices, and oil, and is a great topper for basically anything. </p>
