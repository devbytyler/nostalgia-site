<p>El Asado is a traditional Argentine meal most closely comparable to the American Barbecue but actually totally different and a million more times delish. 
It consists of varios types of meats that have grilled for several hours and generally seasoned with just salt. 
It is likely to be accompanied by many sides and usually eaten on more special occasions as the meat can be expensive.
Its great for parties and lots of company, and has been perfected for hundreds of years by Argentines, the best meat cooks on Earth. </p>
